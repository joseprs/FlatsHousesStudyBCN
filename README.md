# FlatsHousesStudyBCN

In this project I build a **Flat Value Regressor** and I conduct an **end-to-end study and analysis of real estate properties for sale in Barcelona**. First, I develop the data acquisition process. Then, I create a Regression Model to predict the value of new properties, going through all the phases of a Data Science project. And finally, I perform analyses to extract interesting conclusions about prices, mortgages, and neighborhoods.

Here are the four parts with their respective Notebooks. **Each Notebook contains explanations, the process, and conclusions of the analysis**:

- **Flats Web Scraping** *(1.scraping_request.ipynb):* I gather values and characteristics of flats using web scraping techniques.
- **End-to-end Creation of a Flat Value Predictor** *(2.flat_prices_predictor.ipynb)*: I conduct an end-to-end Data Science Project.
- **Value, Value per sqm, and Neighbourhgood Analysis** *(3.value_and_price_per_sqm.ipynb)*: I analyze prices per square meter and by neighborhood.
- **Mortgage/Salary-oriented analysis** *(4.analysis_salary_and_mortgage.ipynb)*: I perform an analysis and extract interesting insights by correlating flat values with salaries and calculating mortgages.
